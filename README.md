# Pickly — Image Color Picker

A small, modern, JavaScript-based image color picker. Load images by uploading, drag & drop, or paste from clipboard. Hover to see a 100×100 circular magnifier and click on the image to pick colors. Each picked color shows HEX, RGB, HSL, CMYK codes and has copy buttons.

How to run

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local dev server).

Features

- Upload, drag & drop, and paste images
- Full-width responsive image display
- Circular 100×100 magnifier following the cursor
- Click to pick pixel color (accurate to image's natural pixel)
- Collected palette with copy buttons

Notes

- For best copy-to-clipboard experience, run in a secure context (file:// works in many browsers; for full clipboard support use `http(s)` served pages).
- No build step required; this is plain HTML/CSS/JS.
