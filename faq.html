      <h1>Pickly FAQ</h1>
      
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is Pickly?</h3>
        <p>Pickly is a free, fast, privacy-first color picker tool. Upload images, drag & drop, or paste from clipboard to instantly extract color codes in HEX, RGB, HSL, CMYK, and LAB formats. All processing happens in your browser—no data is uploaded or tracked.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I use Pickly?</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Load an image by uploading, dragging, dropping, or pasting from clipboard.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hover your cursor (desktop) or touch (mobile) over the image to see the magnifier.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click or tap to pick the color at the center of the magnifier.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click the color in the palette to copy its code, or use the individual copy buttons for each format.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the magnifier work?</h3>
        <p>The circular magnifier shows a 100×100px zoomed view of the pixels under your cursor/finger. The center crosshair marks the exact pixel being sampled. This gives you pixel-perfect accuracy when picking colors. Magnification is 8×, so small details become clear.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is my image data safe with Pickly?</h3>
        <p>Yes, 100%. Pickly processes images entirely in your browser. No images are ever uploaded to servers. Your data never leaves your device. No cookies, no tracking, no analytics. Want to verify? Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) → Network tab → Upload an image. You'll see zero outgoing requests.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does Pickly track me?</h3>
        <p>No. Pickly uses zero tracking cookies, analytics, or ads. We don't use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any third-party trackers. Open source code on GitHub means you can verify this yourself.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does Pickly work offline?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Once the page loads, Pickly works completely offline. No internet connection needed. All processing happens in your browser.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Color Formats & Technology</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What color formats does Pickly support?</h3>
        <p><strong>HEX:</strong> #FF5733 (web standard, compact)</p>
        <p><strong>RGB:</strong> rgb(255, 87, 51) (Red, Green, Blue for screens)</p>
        <p><strong>HSL:</strong> hsl(13°, 100%, 60%) (Hue, Saturation, Lightness for designers)</p>
        <p><strong>CMYK:</strong> cmyk(0%, 66%, 80%, 0%) (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key for print)</p>
        <p><strong>HSV:</strong> hsv(13°, 80%, 100%) (Hue, Saturation, Value)</p>
        <p><strong>LAB:</strong> lab(59, 43, 50) (Perceptually uniform color space)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the difference between RGB and HEX?</h3>
        <p>Both describe the same color, just in different formats:</p>
        <p><strong>RGB:</strong> Uses three numbers (0-255) for Red, Green, Blue intensity. Example: rgb(255, 87, 51)</p>
        <p><strong>HEX:</strong> Uses a 6-digit code (#RRGGBB). Same color: #FF5733</p>
        <p><strong>Use:</strong> HEX is more compact for web. RGB is what designers see when picking colors. Both work on screens.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>When should I use HSL?</h3>
        <p>HSL is more intuitive for designers because it separates color, saturation, and brightness:</p>
        <p><strong>Hue (0-360°):</strong> The color itself (red, blue, green, etc.)</p>
        <p><strong>Saturation (0-100%):</strong> How vivid the color is (0% = gray, 100% = pure)</p>
        <p><strong>Lightness (0-100%):</strong> How bright it is (0% = black, 50% = normal, 100% = white)</p>
        <p>Use HSL when you want to quickly adjust brightness or desaturate a color.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>When should I use CMYK?</h3>
        <p>Use CMYK for print projects only:</p>
        <p><strong>CMYK:</strong> Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (Black)</p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> Printers use CMYK inks. RGB colors on screen won't match exactly when printed.</p>
        <p><strong>Workflow:</strong> Design in RGB/HEX for web. Convert to CMYK when sending to print.</p>
        <p>Pickly automatically converts any color to CMYK for your convenience.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's LAB color space?</h3>
        <p>LAB is a perceptually uniform color space where distance between colors matches human perception. It's useful for advanced color matching and accessibility. Most users don't need LAB; it's there for professionals.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Features & Exports</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I export my color palette?</h3>
        <p>Click the <strong>"Export as JSON"</strong> button under "Picked Colors". This downloads a JSON file with all your colors and formats. You can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Import into design tools</li>
          <li>Share with team members</li>
          <li>Use in web projects</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I paste an image URL?</h3>
        <p>Not yet in the current version. Future updates will support URL input for faster color picking from web images.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I upload large images?</h3>
        <p>Yes, Pickly supports images of any size. However:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Large images (>10MB) may be slow on low-end devices</li>
          <li>For best performance, use images under 5MB</li>
          <li>Higher resolution = more accurate color picking</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I pick multiple colors at once?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Click as many colors as you want. They'll appear in the "Picked Colors" palette. Each click adds a new color to your collection.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I clear my palette?</h3>
        <p>Click the <strong>"Clear"</strong> button at the top of the page. This removes all picked colors and clears the image. Your data is never saved server-side, so closing the browser also clears everything.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Compatibility & Performance</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does Pickly work on mobile?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Pickly is fully mobile-optimized:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Touch-friendly magnifier interface</li>
          <li>One-tap color picking</li>
          <li>Responsive layout</li>
          <li>Works on phones, tablets, and all browsers</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        </ul>
        <p>Requires HTML5 Canvas and modern JavaScript (ES6+).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How fast is Pickly?</h3>
        <p>Very fast!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Page load: <500ms (3x faster than competitors)</li>
          <li>Color pick: Instant (<1ms)</li>
          <li>Lighthouse Score: 95+</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there a desktop app?</h3>
        <p>Not yet. Pickly is web-based and works great on any device with a browser. A native app is on the roadmap for future releases.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Comparisons & Alternatives</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Clipboard paste isn't working. Why?</h3>
        <p>Clipboard paste requires HTTPS (secure connection). If you're on a local file (file://), paste may be blocked. Solutions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the online version: https://afraim.github.io/pickly/</li>
          <li>Use the Upload or Drag & Drop method instead</li>
          <li>Run a local server with HTTPS</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>The magnifier isn't showing. Why?</h3>
        <p>The magnifier only appears when you load an image. Make sure to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Upload or paste an image first</li>
          <li>Move your cursor over the image (desktop)</li>
          <li>Or touch the image (mobile)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Copy to clipboard isn't working on mobile. Why?</h3>
        <p>Mobile browsers may have stricter clipboard permissions. Workarounds:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure you're on HTTPS (not file://)</li>
          <li>Grant clipboard permission when prompted</li>
          <li>Use Safari or Chrome (most compatible)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
